# LiaScript - Interactive Markdown for Education & Documentation

[![LiaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaScript/LiaScript/master/badges/course.svg)](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiaPlayground/LiaScript_WeAreDevelopers2022/master/README.md#1)

---------------------------------------------------------------------


## Motivation 

> Who already has experience in teaching?

> How did you design the materials for your lectures and exercises?

+ no materials - just me and a chalk board
+ Powerpoint 
+ Latex Beamer
+ ...

> Why was it necessary to spend a lot of time creating new materials?

### Challenges in designing teaching materials


### OER as a game changer?

>  **Open Courseware / Open Educational Resources** ... teaching, learning and
> research materials in any medium, digital or otherwise,that reside in the
> **public domain** or have been released under an open license that permits
> no-cost access, use, **adaptation** and **redistribution** by others with no or 4
> limited restrictions. Open licensing is built within the existing framework of
> intellectual property rights as defined by relevant international conventions
> and respects the authorship of the work
